# EVO Beast

EVO Beast was an original game idea, birthed by Yoel Morad from the duress and toils of the roughest cohort to exist in Software Engineering Imersives the 713 Cutthroats, this is the Blueprint of what may quite possibly be the greatest browser window game to grace the pixels on your screen babes.

## EVO Beast Story

Our Story features the "Evo Beast", a heroine protagonist who traverses the world devouring rabbit's, to gain power and evolve in to her stronger form so that she can combat the "Hunter" the human evil that wants to destroy the Evo Beast for no real reason other than the misconception that the Evo Beast is evil, lets think about that for a minute..
how do you think the concept of our game touches on real societal issues? #FoodForMunching.

### Cool Code Snippets of Delicious

CSS3 Rotate/Vert Manipulation for .hack psuedo Matrix Game Title

```css
h4 {
  font-family: "didot";
  color: whitesmoke;
  font-size: 20px;
  margin: 0;
  writing-mode: vertical-lr;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 0.9;
}

.rotate {
  transform: rotate(180deg);
}

.game-title {
  display: grid;
  height: 20vh;
  justify-content: center;
  align-content: center;
  grid-template-columns: max-content max-content;
}
```

HTML5 Canvas, most tend to overlook how beautiful the simplicity in this DoubleDecker cake is

```html
<canvas id="game"><!-- play it, a game --></canvas>
```

The moment our girl evolves lets breathe the essence of that in darling

```javascript
// if the hero's bottom value is > rabbit's top value
if (
  hero.x + hero.width > rabbit.x &&
  hero.x < rabbit.x + rabbit.width &&
  hero.y + hero.height > rabbit.y &&
  hero.y < rabbit.y + rabbit.height
) {
  rabbit.alive = false;
  // add killcounter
  killcounter++;
  // when killcounter = 8 then evolve
  if (killcounter >= 8) {
    hero.evolved = true;
  }
}
```

- What can I really say next about this TITAN in the water, other then why this man is not the Tech Lead for every company out there in existence baffles me, his technical approach and capacity to withstand hordes of complexities while shuffling through them like he was born for this should have earned him the Medal of Honor at this point.<br />
